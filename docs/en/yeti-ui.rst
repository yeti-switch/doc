Contractor:
    company which will interact with the system.

Contractor may act as:

    Customer
        Use provided call termination service.
    Supplier
        Provide call termination service.

One contractor can be either customer and supplier.

**Contractor** has the following attributes:

    Name
        Unique contractor name.
    Enabled
        Self-descriptive.
        If flag is off (contractor disabled) this contractor will not be used for routing and billing.
    Vendor
        If enabled contractor can act as supplier and system may terminate calls to it.
    Customer
        If enabled contractor can act as customer and originate calls to the system.
    Description
        Optional description of the contractor.
    Address
        Optional contractor address.
    Phones
        list of phone numbers to contact with contractor.
    Smtp Connection
        connection to the mail server which will be used to send mails, invoices and notifications
        (SMTP connection must be configured previously in *System->SMTP connections*)

.. note:: Fields **Description**, **Address**, **Phones** are informational and not used in routing or billing logic.

Billing. Contacts
-----------------
Contact:
    Address information about contractor or system operator (contact belongs to the contractor or to the system operator).
    All email notification and reports use only addresses which were added to the contacts.

**Contact** has the following attributes:

Billing. Accounts
-----------------

**Account** attributes:

    Name
        unique account name
    Contractors
        Contractors who own this account.
    Min balance
        If account balance become less than this limit, then traffic for this account will be blocked.
    Max balance
        If account balance become greater than this limit, then routes, which are belongs to this account, will not be used for calls termination.
    Origination capacity
        Maximum capacity which can be originated for this account.
        If incoming calls number exceed origination capacity, then traffic will be blocked.
    Termination capacity
        Maximum capacity which can be terminated for this account.
        If outgoing calls number exceed origination capacity, then routes, which are belongs to this account, will not be used for new calls.
    Vendor invoice period
        Automatic invoices generation period in case when account acts as supplier.
    Customer invoice period
        Automatic invoices generation period in case when account acts as customer.

    Sent invoices to
        Contacts list to send generated invoices
    Timezone
        Timezone which will be used for invoices generation and statistics for this account

Initial balance for newly created account is always zero.
Balance can be changed as result of calls billing or new payments.

For each call:
account balance will be **decreased** on call cost if it uses account for **origination** (customer)
and **increased** if it uses account for **termination** (vendor)

Billing. Payments
-----------------

Payments intended to change account balance.

All payment attributes are self-descriptive (destination account, amount, description and date of payment)


Billing. Invoices
-----------------
Invoice provides possibility to summarize billing information for mutual settlements with customers and suppliers.
Generation of the invoice can be performed manually or automatically,
if invoices autogeneration period for account was choosen.
New invoices are created with status *Pending*.
After the *Approve* invoice considered confirmed and is sent to the contragent email (configured in account settings).
If account has invoice template, system also will generate PDF document.

Billing. Invoice Templates
--------------------------
PDF document templates which will be used to generate invoice.
Template is the file in .odt format with special placeholders.
Placeholders will be replaced with actual data during PDF document generation.
System can store many different templates and you can choose desired template for each account independently

        Ignore remote address negotiated in SDP.
        Use address gained from first received RTP/RTCP packet.
    Symmetric rtp nonstop
        By default, YETI allows to change address by symmetric RTP only one time.
        This option allows to disable this limitation.
        If enabled, YETI will change destination address every time when receives RTP/RTCP packet from another source.
    Symmetric rtp ignore rtcp
        Disable symmetric RTP for RTCP packets
    Force dtmf relay

    Rtp ping
        Useful for cases: when gateways with enabled symmetric RTP wait for first packet before start sending,
        but gateway on other side doing the same.
        If enabled, YETI will send fake RTP packet to the gateway right after stream initialization.
    Rtp timeout
        If set, call will be dropped with appropriate disconnect reason in CDR if no RTP arrived during this interval
    Filter noaudio streams
        Cut all streams except of 'audio' from SDP in INVITE to the termination gateway.
        Appropriate non-audio streams will be automatically inserted as disabled (port set to zero)
        into responses to the gateway which sent offer to comply with RFC.
        Useful for gateways which processes multiple streams in SDP incorrectly or/and rejects INVITES with non-audio streams.
    Rtp relay timestamp aligning
        Normalize timestamp for RTP packets on RTP relay.
        Useful for cases on RTP relay when remote side changes RTP streams
        without appropriate signaling (RTP mark or/and re-INVITE)
        and destination equipment is not ready to process such behavior correctly
    Rtp force relay CN
        If enabled, YETI will relay CN packets on even if they were not negotiated in SDP

    List of codecs
        Each codec has the following attributes:

            Codec
                Codec name. All available codecs are presented in drop-down list
            Priority
                Codec priority in SDP. Less value means higher priority.
                Must be unique within group.

Equipment. LNP database
-----------------------
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_number_portability

Yeti supports interaction with LNP databases by SIP and HTTP REST protocols.
We welcome requests to implement additional protocols or LNP database specific formats.

Name
    Database name. Unique field.
Driver
    Driver which will be used. Available options

        - UDP SIP 301/302 redirect
        - thinQ RESR LRN driver
        - In-memory hash
Host
    Database host (will be ignored by In-memory hash driver)
Port
    Database port
Timeout
    Maximum time to wait for response from database.
    Request will fail with appropriate code and reason.
Thinq username
    Authorization username for thinQ API
Thinq token
    Authorization token for thinQ API
Csv file
    Path to file with data to preload (for In-memory hash driver only)
    
Equipment. RADIUS Auth Profiles
-------------------------------
Yeti поддерживает дополнительную авторизацию входящего звонка на внешнем RADIUS сервере. RADIUS Auth Profile описывает взаимодействие с таким сервером.


Name
    Название профайла. Используется только как информационное поле и не влияет на работу системы. Название профайла должно быть уникально.
Server
    IP адрес или Hostname внешнего RADIUS сервера
Port
    Номер UDP порта, на котором RADIUS сервер ожидает запросы
Secret
    Пароль для авторизации RADIUS сервера.
Reject on error
    Если флаг установлен в true то при ошибке взаимодействия с радиус сервером(таймаут, неверный формат ответа), звонок будет считаться авторизованым и YETI будет выполнять дальнейшую его маршрутизацию. Если флаг установлен в false - при ошибке звонок будет разъединяться с соответствующим кодом разъединения
Timeout
    Таймаут, по истечении заданного кол-ва миллисекунд будет выполняться повтор радиус запроса
Attempts
    Максимальное количество повторов запросов для каждого звонка



System. Sensors
---------------

System supports mirroring of signaling and media traffic.
This functionality can be used for Lawful Interception.
Currently system supports two encapsulation methods:

    - IP-IP tunnel
        Original packets will be encapsulated into additional IP-IP tunnel header.
        This mode allows to route mirrored traffic,
        it's especially useful when destination equipment not available in the same broadcast domain.
    - IP over Ethernet
        In this mode original packets will be encapsulated directly into Ethernet frame using raw sockets.
        Intended to use for cases when destination equipment is in the same L2 domain.

Sensor and logging level can be chosen in gateway settings.
Sensor configuration is separate for A and B leg,
thus for both legs mirroring - sensors must be configured for both termination and origination gateway.
