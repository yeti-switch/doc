        Gateways groups can be managed at *Billing->Gateway Groups*.            
    Priority
        Gateway priority in the gateway group.
        In case of termination to the group, gateways will be arranged according to this priority. If few gateways have same priority, calls will be  balanced between them.
    Pop
        Point of Presence of the gateway. It used to force prioritization when :ref:`prefer same POP <gateway_group_prefer_same_pop>` option enabled for gateway group.
    Allow origination
        Specifies if gateway allowed to originate calls.
    Allow termination
        Specifies if gateway allowed to accept calls from YETI.

    SST ACCEPT501
        If it is enabled (true) Yeti won't terminate a call in case of receiving "501 Not Implemented" on the answer on UPDATE request, otherwise (false) call will be terminated in case of receiving "501 Not Implemented" from remote side.

    Anonymize sdp
        Anonymize client's SDP session data ( session name, uri, origin user ).
    Proxy media
        Determines RTP processing mode. Must be enabled to have possibility of transcoding.
    Single codec in 200ok
        If enabled, YETI will leave only once codec in responses with SDP
        (Exception is only telephone-event.
        It will be added anyway if received in SDP offer and present in codecs group for this gateway).
    Transparent seqno
        Transparent transmission of the RTP SEQ number on RTP relay.
    Transparent ssrc
        Transparent transmission of the RTP SSRC number on RTP relay.
    Force symmetric rtp
        Ignore remote address negotiated in SDP.
        Use address gained from first received RTP/RTCP packet.
    Symmetric rtp nonstop
        By default, YETI allows to change address by symmetric RTP only one time.
        This option allows to disable this limitation.
        If enabled, YETI will change destination address every time when receives RTP/RTCP packet from another source.
    Symmetric rtp ignore rtcp
        Disable symmetric RTP for RTCP packets.
    Rtp ping
        Useful for cases: when gateways with enabled symmetric RTP wait for first packet before start sending,
        but gateway on other side doing the same.
        If enabled, YETI will send fake RTP packet to the gateway right after stream initialization.
    Rtp timeout
        If set, call will be dropped with appropriate disconnect reason in CDR if no RTP arrived during this interval.
    Filter noaudio streams
        Cut all streams except of 'audio' from SDP in INVITE to the termination gateway.
        Appropriate non-audio streams will be automatically inserted as disabled (port set to zero)
        into responses to the gateway which sent offer to comply with RFC.
        Useful for gateways which processes multiple streams in SDP incorrectly or/and rejects INVITES with non-audio streams.
    Rtp relay timestamp aligning
        Normalize timestamp for RTP packets on RTP relay.
        Useful for cases on RTP relay when remote side changes RTP streams
        without appropriate signaling (RTP mark or/and re-INVITE)
        and destination equipment is not ready to process such behavior correctly.
    Rtp force relay CN
        If enabled, YETI will relay CN packets on even if they were not negotiated in SDP.
    Force one way early media
        If this checkbox is enabled Early Media (the ability of two SIP User Agents to communicate before a SIP call is actually established) will be blocked on the way from LegA (Originator) to LegB (Terminator) of the call. It helps to prevent fraud with using Early Media features for making non-billed calls.
    Rtp interface name
        Attribute that is used for changing RTP interface name in the SEMS (SIP Express Media Server) configuration file (sems.conf).

.. _auth_profile_attributes:

    Auth profile attributes
        RADIUS Attributes for including specific authentication, authorization, information and configuration details to the requests and replies. General amount of attributes is regulated by total length of the RADIUS packet (see: `RFC 2865:   Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865>`_).

        -   Type
            The Type of the RADIUS attribute (decimal value between 0 and 255). Regarding to the `RFC 2865:  Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865>`_ values 192-223 are reserved for experimental use, values 224-240 are reserved for implementation-specific use, and values 241-255 are reserved and should not be used. A RADIUS server and client MAY ignore Attributes with an unknown Type.
        -   Name
            Name of attribute. It uses for information only and doesn't transfer in the RADIUS packet.
        -   Is vsa
            If this checkbox is enabled it indicates that it is Vendor Specific Attribute and doesn't described by `RFC 2865 -  Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865>`_.
        -   Vsa vendor
            Decimal value (between 0 and (2^32 - 1)) of the Vendor's ID in the attribute. In the `RFC 2865 -  Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865>`_ - the high-order octet is 0 and the low-order 3 octets are the SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor in network byte order.
        -   Vsa vendor type
            Decimal value (between 0 and 255) of the specific Vendor type of attribute.
        -   Value
            String that is used as template for filling value of RADIUS Attribute with using pre-defined placeholders (variables) that are described in note bellow. It is possible to combine several placeholders together with pre-defined text to one string. Resulting value will be converted to the data of necessary *Format* (see below). In case of impossibility to convert resulting value to necessary *Format* an error will be occurred.

        .. note:: Example of filling *Value* field: Destination ID: $destination_id$ ; DialPeer ID: $dialpeer_id$

        -   Format
            The resulting format of the *Value* field. It is one of six data types: string (1-253 octets containing binary data (values 0 through 255 decimal, inclusive) - often used for printable text strings), octets (1-253 octets containing binary data (values 0 through 255 decimal, inclusive) - often used for binary data), ipaddr (32 bit value, most significant octet first), integer (32 bit unsigned value, most significant octet first), date (32 bit unsigned value, most significant octet first -- seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970), ip6addr (128 bit value, most significant octet first).
        -   Remove
            This control element can be used for removing existing Auth profile attribute. Auth profile attribute will be removed after saving changes (by clicking Update Auth profile) in case of enabling this checkbox.

    Timeout
        Timeout of request after which a request will be repeated (millisecond).
    Attempts

    Enable start accounting
        If enabled, YETI will send Start-accounting packets to external RADIUS server.
    Enable interim accounting
        If enabled, YETI will send Interim-accounting packets to external RADIUS server.
    Interim accounting interval
        Send Interim packets to external RADIUS server every **interval** seconds.
    Enable stop accounting
        If enabled, YETI will send Stop-accounting packets to external RADIUS server.
    Start packet attributes
        RADIUS Attributes for including specific authentication, authorization, information and configuration details into **Start-accounting packets**. Description of fields, principles of their filling and description of placeholders that can be used as variables in the *value* filed are described in the :ref:`Auth profile attributes <auth_profile_attributes>` section.
    Interim packet attributes
        RADIUS Attributes for including specific authentication, authorization, information and configuration details into **Interim packet attributes**. Description of fields, principles of their filling and description of placeholders that can be used as variables in the *value* filed are described in the :ref:`Auth profile attributes <auth_profile_attributes>` section.
    Stop packet attributes
        RADIUS Attributes for including specific authentication, authorization, information and configuration details into **Stop packet attributes**.
