Id
    Unique identifier of the Service Type.

Name
    Human-readable name of the Service Type.

Force Renew
    When enabled, this flag forces service renewal even if the customerâ€™s account
    balance is insufficient (``balance <= min_balance``).
    In this case, the service is renewed and the corresponding price is still charged.
