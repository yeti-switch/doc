Management server installation
==============================

Since version 1.6.3-175 we started to use central configuration server
to store yeti module configuration for all nodes in cluster.

Packages installation
---------------------

.. code-block:: console

    # apt update && apt install yeti-management

Configuration files
-------------------

/etc/yeti/management.cfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains configuration for management daemon.

Set desired logging level and address to listen.

You can set multiple addresses separated by comma to listen on multiple interfaces.

Possible log_level values are: (1 - error, 2 - info, 3 - debug)

.. code-block:: c

    daemon {
      listen = {
        "tcp://0.0.0.0:4444"
      }
      log_level = 2
    }

/etc/yeti/system.cfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains configuration for all nodes.
Each top-level section defines configuration for node of certain type
(signaling is for traffic switch nodes).
All top-level sections contains mandatory section globals
which must have all possible values common for all nodes.
Then there is named sections for each node_id which may contain
values overriding ones set in global section.

Note: even if your node does not have
any specific values you have to define empty section
for this node anyway, otherwise management node
will not provide configuration for node with this id.

Example of minimal configuration file for node with id 8

.. code-block:: c

    signalling {
      globals {
        yeti {

.. warning:: You should define all Nodes that has been created at web interface by their IDs. See :ref:`System->Nodes <nodes>` menu. SEMS node will refuse to start if corresponding node is not defined at system.cfg


Management server launch
------------------------

Launch configured management server instance:

.. code-block:: console

    # service yeti-management start

Checks
------

Check file /var/log/yeti/yeti-management.log for daemon logs:

.. code-block:: console

    # tail -2 /var/log/yeti/yeti-management.log
    Sep 12 12:54:47 evial yeti-management[25376]: [25376]
