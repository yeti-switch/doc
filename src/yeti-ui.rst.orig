        Determines RTP processing mode. Must be enabled to have possibility of transcoding.
    Single codec in 200ok
        If enabled, YETI will leave only once codec in responses with SDP
        (exception is only telephone-event.

    Transparent ssrc
        Transparent transmission of the RTP SSRC number on RTP relay
    Force symmetric rtp
        Ignore remote address negotiated in SDP.
        Use address gained from first received RTP/RTCP packet.

    Symmetric rtp ignore rtcp
        Disable symmetric RTP for RTCP packets
    Force dtmf relay
        Don't process telephone-event (RFC2833) packets and relay them 'as is'.

            - SIP INFO application/dtmf-relay OR application/dtmf
            - RFC 2833 OR SIP INFO
    Rtp ping
        Useful for cases: when gateways with enabled symmetric RTP wait for first packet before start sending,
        but gateway on other side doing the same.
        If enabled, YETI will send fake RTP packet to the gateway right after stream initialization.
    Rtp timeout
        If set, call will be dropped with appropriate disconnect reason in CDR if no RTP arrived during this interval
    Filter noaudio streams
        Cut all streams except of 'audio' from SDP in INVITE to the termination gateway.
        Appropriate non-audio streams will be automatically inserted as disabled (port set to zero)
        into responses to the gateway which sent offer to comply with RFC.
        Useful for gateways which processes multiple streams in SDP incorrectly or/and rejects INVITES with non-audio streams.
    Rtp relay timestamp aligning
        Normalize timestamp for RTP packets on RTP relay.
        Useful for cases on RTP relay when remote side changes RTP streams
        without appropriate signaling (RTP mark or/and re-INVITE)
        and destination equipment is not ready to process such behavior correctly
    Rtp force relay CN
        If enabled, YETI will relay CN packets on even if they were not negotiated in SDP

Routing
-------

<<<<<<< HEAD
Customer Auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This entity authenticates calls from customers or gateways, applies them to
routing table and has some useful filters and options.

Customer Auth form is splitted to 3 tabs and each one is described below.

*General* tab
`````````````

    Name
        Unique name of Accounting profile.
        Uses for informational purposes and doesn't affect system behaviour.
    Enabled
        IP address or hostname of external RADIUS server.
    Customer
        Customer, who this Customer Auth belongs to
    Account
        Accout of Customer, which this Customer Auth belongs to
    Gateway
        Gateway which related to this Customer Auth. That gateway(its parameters),
        will be used for media handling on the A-leg of a call.
    Rateplan
        Rateplan, which this Customer Auth belongs to
    Routing Plan
        Routing Plan, which this Customer Auth belongs to
    Dst Numberlist
        You may apply Dst Numberlist (Destination) and check B-numbers, by prefix or
        full-match, then reject it or allow.
    Src Numberlist
        You may apply Src Numberlist (Source) and check B-numbers, by prefix or
        full-match, then reject it or allow.
    Dump Level
        It is possible to capture calls to PCAP files, using this option.
        You may choose what kind of information should be captured.

        Possible values are:
            - Capture nothing
            - Capture all traffic
            - Capture RTP traffic
            - Capture signalling traffic
    Enable Audio Recording
        If checked, the media for calls passing through this Customer Auth will be stored
        in WAV files.
    Capacity
        The capacity of the Customer Auth, i.e. how many calls it accepts at the moment.
    Allow Receive Rate Limit
        A Customer may send special SIP-header in which he send the price for this call he wants to pay.
        And YETI will rely on this price on the routing stage if we allow such a behaviour.
    Send Billing Information
        If enabled, YETI adds the special SIP-header into 200 SIP-message, which contains
        current price for calls, in order to a Customer should be informed.

Match condition options
```````````````````````
    This part is crucial for authentication process of incoming calls. You should note that a one
    customer may have many of Customer Auth with almost the same parameters, so pay
    attention to parameters besides Ip address.

    Transport Protocol
        Transport protocol TCP/UDP, which the customer uses for sending calls to YETI.
    Ip
        IP address of the originator(customer).
    Pop
        Point of precense, which recieves calls from the customer. If a call will come
        on the different PoP (a node which recieves calls belongs to different a PoP), such calls
        will be dropped.
    Src Prefix
        You can define a prefix which necessarily should be presented in a Src-number for every
        call from the customer. If not - a call will be dropped. Just a prefix must be used here, not a
        regular expression.
    Dst Prefix
        You can define a prefix which necessarily should be presented in a Dst-number for every
        call from the customer. If not - a call will be dropped. Just a prefix must be used here, not a
        regular expression.
    Uri Domain
        If specified, YETI checks the domain part of the URI for every call, and drop calls
        if the domain part is not the same as specified.
    From Domain
        If specified, YETI checks the domain part of the URI in the From header for every call, and drop calls
        if presented domain mismatches.
    To Domain
        If specified, YETI checks the domain part of the URI in the To header for every call, and drop calls
        if presented domain mismatches.
    X Yeti Auth
        It's possible to define the custom SIP-header **X-Yeti-Auth** for the customer's calls and specify its value in
        YETI. In case they match, YETI passes such calls through.

*Number translation* tab
````````````````````````

    Diversion policy
        Defines what to do with Diversion header within SIP-signalization.
        Default value is "Clear header", so this header will be deleted.
    Diversion rewrite rule
        This option should contain a regular expression for changing a Diversion header

System
------

Global configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The page contains global parameters of YETI.

**Global configuration** attributes:

Rows Per Page
    This option affords to change drop-down 'Per page' element, which is exists on every list-type page in YETI.
    You can add additional values to that drop-down list if default values '30,50,100' are not sufficient.
CDR Unload Dir
    Directory where YETI unload CDR tables on the *CDR -> Tables* page.
CDR Unload URI
    URL for external CDR viewer program. YETI redirects to that program from *CDR -> Tables* page when user press **Unloaded files** button.
CDR Archive Delay
    Move CDRs to archive table after **N** months.
CDR Remove Delay
    Remove archived tables after **N** months.
Max Records
    Maximum amount of records which YETI can save to CSV file on every list-type page (*Download: CSV* button at the bottom of page).
Import Max Threads
    Number of threads for import from CSV proccess.
Import Helpers Dir
    Helper directory where YETI saves temporary files durring import from CSV process.
Active Calls Require Filter
    Requre any filter on the *RT data -> Active Calls* page.
Registrations Require Filter
    Require any filter on the *RT data -> Outgoing Registrations* page.
Active Calls Show Chart
    If **true** YETI shows chart of active calls on the *RT data -> Active Calls* page.
Active Calls Autorefresh Enable
    If **true** YETI will refresh *RT data -> Active Calls* page every 20 seconds.
Max Call Duration
    Global parameter of maximum call duration (seconds).
Random Disconnect Enable
    If **true** YETI will randomly disconnect calls whose duration more than **Random Disconnect Length** by sendind BYE message to parties.
Random Disconnect Length
    Duration of calls (seconds) which YETI will disconnect if **Random Disconnect Enable** enabled.
Drop Call If LNP Fail
    If **true** YETI drops calls if request to LNP database is not successfull.
LNP Cache TTL
    Time to life of LNP cache (seconds).
LNP E2E Timeout
    Timeout for requests to LNP database (seconds). YETI will drop calls if **Drop Call If LNP Fail** enabled and timeout expired or bad response returned.
Short Call Length
    User may decide which calls are 'short' by this settings (seconds). It involves **Short Calls** filter button on the *CDR -> CDR History* page.
Termination Stats Window
    Interval (hours) for generating of stats for gateway or dialpeer (*Short Window Stats* panel on page of every gateway or dialpeer).
Quality Control Min Calls
    Minimum number of calls for building **Quality Control** statistics.
Quality Control Min Duration
    Total duration of calls for building **Quality Control** statistics.

----

Nodes
~~~~~

List of YETI nodes connected to current cluster.
Every node represents independent installation of YETI-SEMS, which communicate to management interface via RPC protocol.

Attributes:

Name
        Node name.
Pop
        Point of presence. Might be useful for logic grupping of nodes (different data-centers, as example).
Signalling ip
        IP address of node.
Signaling port
        Network port for sending SIP-packets (dafault value 5060).
Rpc endpoint
        IP address and port on which YETI-SEMS is waiting for RPC connections.

In view mode user can use next tabs:

Details
        Common information about node.
Active Calls Chart
        Show the next graphs:
        - Active calls for 24 hours.
        - Calls count for month.
Comments
        Comments of user for current node.

----

Networks
~~~~~~~~

Catalogue of carriers. It contains names of carriers and uses in **Network prefixes** then.

----

Network Prefixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Catalogue of phone prefixes, which contains:

    - Prefix
    - Operator network name
    - Country this prefix belongs to

Yeti database contains preloaded data of prefixes. User could edit them or add another.

----

Sensors
~~~~~~~

System supports mirroring of signaling and media traffic.
This functionality can be used for Lawful Interception.
Currently system supports two encapsulation methods:

    - IP-IP tunnel
        Original packets will be encapsulated into additional IP-IP tunnel header.
        This mode allows to route mirrored traffic,
        it's especially useful when destination equipment not available in the same broadcast domain.
    - IP over Ethernet
        In this mode original packets will be encapsulated directly into Ethernet frame using raw sockets.
        Intended to use for cases when destination equipment is in the same L2 domain.

Sensor and logging level can be chosen in gateway settings.
Sensor configuration is separate for A and B leg,
thus for both legs mirroring - sensors must be configured for both termination and origination gateway.

----

SMTP connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is necessary to have an SMTP connection in order to YETI can send invoices and alerts to customers. Then user can choose SMTP connection for Customer.

**SMTP connections** attributes:

Name
    Unique name of SMTP connection.
    Uses for informational purposes and doesn't affect system behaviour.
Host
    IP address or hostname of SMTP server.
Port
    TCP port on which SMTP server wait for requests (*default value: 25*).
From address
    E-mail address of sender.
Auth user
	Username for Authorization procedure on external SMTP server.
Auth password
    Password for Authorization procedure on external SMTP server.
Global
	Set as global for all customers.
