Routing Plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Routing Plans are used for describing common parameters that can be applied for set of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` that are specified by :ref:`Routing Groups <routing_group>`.

**Routing Plan**'s attributes:
``````````````````````````````

    .. _routing_plan_id:

    Id
        Unique Routing Plan's id.
    Name
        Unique Routing Plan name.

    .. _routing_plan_sorting:

    Sorting
        This field is used for setting sorting method for the routes (Dialpeers) within *Routing Plan*. Regardless from the sorting method all :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>`  within *Routing Plan* will be filtered by using following rules:

    -   :ref:`Prefix <dialpeer_prefix>` of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record is in the prefix range of **URI name** (destination) that was processed by Number translations procedures (if any);

    .. note:: Examples:

       -    Prefix of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = ** ; **URI name** = *0662296132* => **TRUE**
       -    Prefix of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *066* ; **URI name** = *0662296132* => **TRUE**
       -    Prefix of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *066[1-3]* ; **URI name** = *0662296132* => **TRUE**
       -    Prefix of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *066[1-3]* ; **URI name** = *0665296132* => **FALSE**

    -   Length of **URI name** (destination)  that was processed by Number translations procedures (if any) is between :ref:`Dst number min and max length <dialpeer_dst_number_min_length>` values of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record;

    .. note:: Examples:

       -    Dst number min length of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *3* ; Dst number max length of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *15* ; **URI name** = *380662296132* => **TRUE**
       -    Dst number min length of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *7* ; Dst number max length of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *7* ; **URI name** = *7050460* => **TRUE**
       -    Dst number min length of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *0* ; Dst number max length of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record = *7* ; **URI name** = *0487050460* => **FALSE**

    -   :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record is still :ref:`valid <dialpeer_valid_dates>`;

    -   :ref:`Balance <account_balance>` of :ref:`Vendor's Account <dialpeer_vendor>` (that was chosen for the :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>`) is less than :ref:`Max balance <account_max_balance>` value of this Account;

    -   :ref:`Contractor <contractors>` that :ref:`was chosen <dialpeer_vendor>` for the :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` is enabled and has type: **Vendor**;

    -   :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` that were chosen for the call at the previous steps (Authentication, Numberlist processing etc.) and :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` that were chosen in the field :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` are matched to each other.

     .. note:: Examples:

        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **null**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **null**  =>  **TRUE** (matched);
        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **Tag1**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **null**  =>  **FALSE** (not matched);
        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **null**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **Tag1**  =>  **FALSE** (not matched);
        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **Tag1**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **Tag2**  =>  **FALSE** (not matched);
        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **Tag2**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **Tag2**  =>  **TRUE** (matched);
        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **Tag1**, **Tag2**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **Tag2**  =>  **TRUE** (matched);
        -  :ref:`Routing tags <routing_tag>` of the call: **Tag1**; :ref:`Routing tag ids <dialpeer_routing_tag_ids>` that were chosen: **Tag1**, **Tag2**  =>  **TRUE** (matched);


        The following algorithms (sorting methods) are available:

            **LCR, No ACD&ASR control** - Sorting only on the basis of least-cost routing (LCR) algorithm (routes with lowest price will be on the top of rating) without control of :ref:`Acd Limit <dialpeer_acd_limit>` and :ref:`Asr Limit <dialpeer_asr_limit>` parameters of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>`.

            **Prio,LCR, ACD&ASR control** - Sorting on the basis of internal :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` with following sorting on the basis of least-cost routing (LCR) algorithm (routes with highest priorities will be on the top of rating, in case of same priorities LCR sorting will be used) with control of :ref:`Acd Limit <dialpeer_acd_limit>` and :ref:`Asr Limit <dialpeer_asr_limit>` parameters of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` (routes where values of these parameters are less than presetuped limits couldn't be chosen for routing).

            **LCR,Prio, ACD&ASR control** - Sorting on the basis of least-cost routing (LCR) algorithm with following sorting on the basis of internal :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` (routes with lowest price will be on the top of rating, in case of same prices sorting on priorities will be used) with control of :ref:`Acd Limit <dialpeer_acd_limit>` and :ref:`Asr Limit <dialpeer_asr_limit>` parameters of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` (routes where values of these parameters are less than presetuped limits couldn't be chosen for routing).

            **LCRD, Prio, ACD&ASR control** - Sorting on the basis of modified least-cost routing (LCR) algorithm with following sorting on the basis of internal :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` (routes with lowest price will be on the top of rating, in case of same prices sorting on priorities will be used) with control of :ref:`Acd Limit <dialpeer_acd_limit>` and :ref:`Asr Limit <dialpeer_asr_limit>` parameters of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` (routes where values of these parameters are less than presetuped limits couldn't be chosen for routing). Difference of this algorithm from the classic LCR algorithm is on the using :ref:`Rate Delta Max <rate_delta_max>` value during the sorting of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` by price. :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` with prices that are different one from other less than :ref:`Rate Delta Max <rate_delta_max>` value will be on one level of sorting by price and :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` will be used for building routing rating between them.

            **Route testing** - This mode of sorting usually used for testing routes from different Vendors. In this mode you can use especial format of destination number: XX*YYYYYYYYYY, where XX - :ref:`Vendor ID <contractor_id>` and YYYYYYYYYY - phone number. In this mode most preffered :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` of :ref:`Vendor <contractors>` with XX ID will be used for the routing.

            **QD-Static, LCR, ACD&ASR control** - Sorting on the basis of modified internal :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` with following sorting on the basis of least-cost routing (LCR) algorithm (routes with highest priorities will be on the top of rating, in case of same priorities LCR sorting will be used) with control of :ref:`Acd Limit <dialpeer_acd_limit>` and :ref:`Asr Limit <dialpeer_asr_limit>` parameters of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` (routes where values of these parameters are less than presetuped limits couldn't be chosen for routing). In this method of sorting :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` of :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` will be re-writen by :ref:`Priority <routing_plan_static_route_priority>` of the :ref:`Routing plan static route <routing_plan_static_route>` (if this static route is present in this *Routing plan*).

            **Static only, No ACD&ASR control** - Sorting only on the basis of :ref:`Priority <routing_plan_static_route_priority>` of the :ref:`Routing plan static route <routing_plan_static_route>` (if this static route is present in this *Routing plan*) without control of :ref:`Acd Limit <dialpeer_acd_limit>` and :ref:`Asr Limit <dialpeer_asr_limit>` parameters of :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>`. Routes with highest priorities will be on the top of rating. Routing will be done only in case of presence of :ref:`Routing plan static route <routing_plan_static_route>` record and :ref:`Dialpeer <dialpeers>` record that are related to this *Routing plan*.

    .. _routing_plan_use_lnp:

    Use Lnp
        If this flag is enabled to all calls with ported numbers that are associated with this *Routing plan* via :ref:`Customer Auth <customer_auth>` record, will be applied local number portability procedure (receiving information from :ref:`LNP Cache <lnp_caches>` or sending request to :ref:`LNP Database <lnp_databases>`.

    .. _rate_delta_max:

    Rate Delta Max
        This value is used for *LCRD, Prio, ACD&ASR control* method of sorting. You should setup this value in case of using this method of sorting. :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` with prices that are different one from other less than :ref:`Rate Delta Max <rate_delta_max>` value will be on one level of sorting by price and :ref:`Priority <dialpeer_priority>` will be used for building routing rating between them.
    Routing Groups
        :ref:`Routing Groups <routing_group>` that are related to this *Routing Plan*. The rules that are described in this *Routing plan* will be applied to all :ref:`Dialpeers <dialpeers>` that are associated with chosen :ref:`Routing Groups <routing_group>`.
