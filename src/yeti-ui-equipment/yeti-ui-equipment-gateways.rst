    SST ACCEPT501
        If it is enabled (true) Yeti won't terminate a call in case of receiving "501 Not Implemented" on the answer on UPDATE request, otherwise (false) call will be terminated in case of receiving "501 Not Implemented" from remote side.

Media **Gateway**'s attributes:
```````````````````````````````
    Sdp c location
        Location of connection-line in SDP payloads which are generated by YETI.
        Possible values:

            - On media level
            - On session level
            - On session and media level
    Codec group
        Codecs group which will be used to interact with this gateway.
    Anonymize sdp
        Anonymize client's SDP session data ( session name, uri, origin user ).
    Proxy media
        Determines RTP processing mode. Must be enabled to have possibility of transcoding.
    Single codec in 200ok
        If enabled, YETI will leave only once codec in responses with SDP
        (Exception is only telephone-event.
        It will be added anyway if received in SDP offer and present in codecs group for this gateway).
    Transparent seqno
        Transparent transmission of the RTP SEQ number on RTP relay.
    Transparent ssrc
        Transparent transmission of the RTP SSRC number on RTP relay.
    Force symmetric rtp
        Ignore remote address negotiated in SDP.
        Use address gained from first received RTP/RTCP packet.
    Symmetric rtp nonstop
        By default, YETI allows to change address by symmetric RTP only one time.
        This option allows to disable this limitation.
        If enabled, YETI will change destination address every time when receives RTP/RTCP packet from another source.
    Symmetric rtp ignore rtcp
        Disable symmetric RTP for RTCP packets.
    Rtp ping
        Useful for cases: when gateways with enabled symmetric RTP wait for first packet before start sending,
        but gateway on other side doing the same.
        If enabled, YETI will send fake RTP packet to the gateway right after stream initialization.
    Rtp timeout
        If set, call will be dropped with appropriate disconnect reason in CDR if no RTP arrived during this interval.
    Filter noaudio streams
        Cut all streams except of 'audio' from SDP in INVITE to the termination gateway.
        Appropriate non-audio streams will be automatically inserted as disabled (port set to zero)
        into responses to the gateway which sent offer to comply with RFC.
        Useful for gateways which processes multiple streams in SDP incorrectly or/and rejects INVITES with non-audio streams.
    Rtp relay timestamp aligning
        Normalize timestamp for RTP packets on RTP relay.
        Useful for cases on RTP relay when remote side changes RTP streams
        without appropriate signaling (RTP mark or/and re-INVITE)
        and destination equipment is not ready to process such behavior correctly.
    Rtp force relay CN
        If enabled, YETI will relay CN packets on even if they were not negotiated in SDP.
    Force one way early media
        If this checkbox is enabled Early Media (the ability of two SIP User Agents to communicate before a SIP call is actually established) will be blocked on the way from LegA (Originator) to LegB (Terminator) of the call. It helps to prevent fraud with using Early Media features for making non-billed calls.
    Rtp interface name
        Attribute that is used for changing RTP interface name in the SEMS (SIP Express Media Server) configuration file (sems.conf).
